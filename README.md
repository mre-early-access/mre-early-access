## 🐥 Who am I?

Whenever I find the time, I create content and make things.

This can be a faster JSON parser or a tiny, fully static search engine compiled to WebAssembly. Overall I've created over 100 open-source projects. I also maintain a Visual Studio Code plugin, snippet, with 25k active users and a list of [awesome static analysis tools](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis that has 7.5k+ stars and gets a lot of traffic. On top of that, I like to write about my projects on endler.dev and do some Hello, Rust! once per year or so.
I also talk about Rusty things at meetups and conferences like FOSDEM, RustBeltRust, Codemotion, and RustFest.

## 🎀 Why should you sponsor me?

Donations make me worry less about financing my work and focus more on creating.

My goal is to inspire people and empower them to work on open-source themselves.
Doing all of the above next to my day job requires quite some effort.

If you like me to do more open-source in the future, I'd appreciate your donation — big or small. ❤️
And if you change your mind, you can stop sponsoring me anytime, guilt-free.

## 👀 Early access

Sponsors will also have early access to work-in-progress tools and libraries before they are made public.
